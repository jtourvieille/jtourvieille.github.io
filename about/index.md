Hi, I am Jounad Tourvieille, a passionnate .Net developper.

I have been working with .Net technologies for 10+ years.

In recent years, I worked for financial investment banks, but I have also worked in other sectors such as the automotive industry or telecommunications.

In my career, I've been Tech Lead & Team Lead, but now, I focus on pure coding.

I particularly like design patterns, algorithms and architectural structures.
